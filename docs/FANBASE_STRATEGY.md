# Fanbase Strategy

Papito Mamito’s mission to uplift the diaspora thrives when the community feels seen, celebrated, and empowered. This playbook maps out how the fanbase engine should operate alongside the creative workflows.

## Pillars
1. **Gratitude Recognition** – Every supporter receives intentional shout-outs across blogs, livestreams, and merch drops.
2. **Value Exchange** – Fans gain access to behind-the-scenes rituals, early track previews, and empowerment prompts.
3. **Community Activation** – Encourage meetups, digital dance challenges, and remix collaborations.
4. **Transparency** – Maintain open logs of supporters, donations, and merch availability to build trust.

## Fan Levels
| Level | Description | Benefits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Friend | Curious supporter exploring the movement | Daily blog & email digest |
| Core | Regular listener / sharer | Early access to song roughs, gratitude shout-outs |
| VIP | Financial supporter / host | Exclusive merch drops, private listening parties |
| Investor | Strategic backer | Quarterly briefings, co-creation workshops |

## Workflow Integration
1. **Capture** – Use `papito fan add` during livestreams or fan submission forms.
2. **Celebrate** – Generate shout-outs via `papito fan shoutouts` and embed in blog posts or social copy.
3. **Measure** – Track fan growth and engagement by periodically exporting fanbase JSON to dashboards.
4. **Respond** – Note feedback in the `notes` field, then tailor future releases or merch for top supporters.

## Key Rituals
- Weekly gratitude livestream listing newest supporters.
- Monthly “Value Over Vanity” challenge celebrating a fan story.
- Quarterly virtual town hall to preview Papito’s next creative season.
