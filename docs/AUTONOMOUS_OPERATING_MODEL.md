# Autonomous Operating Model

Papito Mamito AI operates as a collection of modular services that form a self-sustaining creative ecosystem.

## Layers
1. **Creative Intelligence (CI):** Models and prompt engineering for lyrics, melodies, arrangements, and narrative voice.
2. **Orchestration Layer:** Workflow engine scheduling releases, tracking dependencies, and triggering QA checks.
3. **Knowledge Base:** Structured memory of releases, blog posts, fan engagements, and cultural references.
4. **Experience Layer:** APIs, web portals, and social automations that deliver Papito's creations to the world.

## Key Processes
- **Song lifecycle:** Ideation -> Composition -> Arrangement -> Mix direction -> Distribution -> Promotion.
- **Blog lifecycle:** Context ingestion -> Draft generation -> Tone QA -> Publishing -> Syndication.
- **Fan engagement:** Monitor KPIs -> Respond with gratitude -> Launch activations and challenges.

## Autonomy Safeguards
